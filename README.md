# EASY AND SINGLE-POINT ACCESS TO COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT SEVERAL WELFARE SCHEMES OF THE GOVERNMENT 

## Introduction:
India is one of the largest democratic countries in the world. As we all say that a Democratic Government is “Of the people, for the people and by the people” and this is one of the main reasons why the Governments announce Welfare Schemes for various sections of society from time to time. These schemes help in the upliftment of the socially, economically, culturally marginalised communities. 

## Problem:
But one of the major hurdles which come in their way is the lack of proper information regarding these beneficial schemes. These schemes could be either Central, State specific or a joint collaboration between the Centre and the States. So we have decided to provide a solution for this problem by providing a proper channel for the correct information to be conveyed to the concerned people. 

## Solution Proposed:
We will attempt to provide easy and single-point access to information about several welfare schemes of the Government and their various aspects (including eligible beneficiaries, types of benefits, scheme details etc.) by implementing a web crawler that will crawl through various Government websites. We will try to include as many states as possible and as many categories of schemes. We will also provide functionalities through which people will get notified about schemes relevant to them, if possible, in their native languages along with speech recognition and text-to-speech features.
